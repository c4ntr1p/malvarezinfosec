        <h2 style="color:lavender;">Brief Bio:</h2>
        <p style="color:lavender;">
            I'm a passionate and dedicated worker, and if you'll indulge me I'd like to share a little background on myself. I graduated from Georgia State University with a BA in Anthropology, which laid my investigative foundation. Later, I joined the Kennesaw Police Department where I worked for six years in various roles. In October of 2021 I left Law Enforcement and became a full time stay-at-home dad. This was a wonderful opportunity to spend quality time with my son, but also allowed me the flexibility to begin my Master's program in Cybersecurity at Excelsior University.

        <p style="color:lavender;"> 
            I've been diving into mini-projects, which has been awesome became I love learning new things and exploring technology. Whether it's the practical applications of Offensive Security strategies I've learned using the game-ified virtual machine 'GreyHack', setting up a TCP server on my Raspberry Pi to send messages between it and my homelab desktop, or just learning the flexibility of the Python language; every day's incredibly exciting!
