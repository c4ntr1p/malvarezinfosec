        <h2 style="color:lavender;">Brief Bio:</h2>
        <p style="color:lavender;">
            I'm a passionate and dedicated worker, and if you'll indulge me I'd like to share a little background on myself. I graduated from Georgia State University with a BA in Anthropology, which laid my investigative foundation. Later, I joined the Kennesaw Police Department where I worked for six years in various roles. I was offered a role with Target in 2021, which I accepted to transition out of Law Enforcement, allow me the flexibility to be a stay at home dad, and to begin my Master's program in Cybersecurity.
